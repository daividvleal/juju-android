Aims to guide exercising the perineal muscles and develop self-awareness amongst woman

### What?
The perineum is a set of muscles found in the pelvis that is part of the pelvic floor. It is responsible for supporting the pelvic organs such as the uterus, bladder, vagina and colon.

### Why?
The perineal muscles should be able to perform an automatic contraction to maintain bladder control. This should be possible even in the case of coughing, laughing or lifting heavy loads. However, these muscles may be weakened due to excess weight, hormonal changes, pregnancy, childbirth or pelvic surgery. A weak perineum can be manifested by urinary and fecal incontinence as well as genital prolapse. It is by remaining toned that the perineum retains urine and prevents urinary leakage.

### How?
Physiotherapy can help training the perineal muscles to improve their strength, flexibility, tone and endurance. It aims to normalize the urinary system, strengthen the pelvic floor, reduce the pain during sexual intercourse, among other things. Different techniques are used, such as biofeedback, electrical stimulation, manual techniques, re-education and a personalized exercise program. Juju leverages the latter in order to promote awareness amongst woman.
